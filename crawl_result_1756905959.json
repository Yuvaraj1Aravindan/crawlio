You deserve an explanation, so please don't skip this 1-minute read. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. If so, please join the 2% of readers who give to keep this resource available for all. After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—an oasis of free and collaborative knowledge. By visiting Wikipedia today, you're choosing a free and fair internet: a space to find facts you need without the distraction of ads or the agendas of wealthy owners. If you are undecided, remember most readers don't donate, so any contribution helps – and monthly gifts are the best option for a lasting impact. So if Wikipedia provides you with $2.75 of knowledge, please donate today. Thank you. Knowledge is human. An important update for readers in the United States.

A dream that came together piece by piece. Now, with 65 million articles and 260,000 volunteers across the world, Wikipedia is the internet we were promised—a place created by humans, for humans. Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful, others because they realize knowledge needs humans. If you agree, please give $2.75. Any contribution helps, whether it's $2.75 one time or monthly.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever.
